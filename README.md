Here's an explanation of your reinforcement learning project using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to train an agent to follow a line in a 2D space:

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning environment where an agent learns to follow a line in a 2D space using the DDPG algorithm. The environment is created using the Gymnasium library (formerly known as OpenAI Gym), and the DDPG implementation is from the Stable-Baselines3 library.
